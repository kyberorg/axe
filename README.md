### Note on Anti-scam redirect page
Since release `3.0.5` by default when user opens short link instead of redirect appears redirect page with destination
link. This was done intentionally to prevent scam, phishing and malware activities.

To bypass this page just add manually `+` symbol to end of your short link. For
example: [https://axe.pm/Cxwycs+](https://axe.pm/Cxwycs+)
