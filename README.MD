## For Ops
### How to Deploy app ?

* Our docker image: `yadev/yals`

* We need H2 (default profile) or MySQL database (local profile) to run

* We use [BugSnag](https://app.bugsnag.com/yadev/yals/errors) for capturing bugs. So token from Bugsnag needed.
#### Docker Swarm

EnvVars: 

* SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: `dev,qa or prod`

* DB_HOST: `hostname or service (container) name`

* DB_NAME: `database name`

* DB_USER: `username for database`

* YALS_DB_PASSWORD or YALS_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: `password for db user`

* TELEGRAM_TOKEN or TELEGRAM_TOKEN_FILE: `token for telegram bot`

* BUGSNAG_TOKEN or BUGSNAG_TOKEN_FILE: `token for BugSnag`

Optional EnvVars: 

* LOG_LEVEL_APP: `see Logging part`

* PORT: `start server at port other than 8080 `

* SERVER_URL: `https://yals.tld` (most likely don't needed as regulated by Spring profile)

* TELEGRAM_ENABLED `true/false` (most likely don't needed as regulated by Spring profile)

Ports: 

* host port: `select yourself`

* container port: `8080 (or PORT)`

Secrets:

* yals_db_password: `database password`

* yals_telegram_token: `telegram bot token`

## For Developers
### Common info ###

* We use [slack](https://app.slack.com/client/TRVM22544/CRW52SCLQ)

* We use [BugSnag](https://app.bugsnag.com/yadev/yals/errors)

### How to start coding ?

* Git clone ``` git clone repoUrl ```

* Import into IDE as **Maven** project

* Select all autodetected Spring facets

* Use ``` YalsApplication.main() ``` to run application in IDE

### About: local profile
To develop with locally running dockerized MySQL database use `local` profile.

Profile can activated in IDEA or by setting env `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` to `local`

MySQL can be started from `docker/localMySQL` directory by running:

```
docker-compose up -d
``` 

MySQL can be stopped from `docker/localMySQL` directory by running:

```
docker-compose down
```

Use `@yals_local_bot` and its token (currently can be requested from [kyberorg](mailto:kyberorg@yadev.eu)) for local run

### Logging
To adjust logging we use ENV variables or `-D` vars: 

* Use `LOG_LEVEL_CORE` or `-Dlog.level.core` for setting overall log level
* Use `LOG_LEVEL_APP` or `-Dlog.level.app` for setting application (package: `ee.yals`) log level
* Use `LOG_LEVEL_SPRING` or `-Dlog.level.spring` for setting Spring (package: `org.springframework`) log level
* Use `LOG_LEVEL_DB` or `-Dlog.level.db` for setting Database SQL (package: `org.hibernate`) log level
